    <h2>A part of me</h2>
    <h4>Verse 1</h4>
    <p>Coming home to the sentence saying, I missed you<br> 
        And to see your happy face again <br>
        There is not a single moment that I ever think the thought<br> 
        Of not returning again <br>
        Summer went, got pale once more <br>
        A brand new city I have to explore <br>
        I've been searching for good answers and wisdom <br>
        I keep on coming back with less, 'cause I've lost home</p> 
        
    <h4>Chorus</h4>
    <p> She does not know, that a part of me has left home <br>
        Is never ever coming back, there's nothing I can do with that <br>
        She does not know, that a part of me has left home <br>
        Is never ever coming back, never ever coming back</p>
    
    <h4>Verse 2</h4>
    <p>There's no sleep for the living nowadays <br>
        Hanging in there with a steady course <br>
        I can feel it from the back of my spine <br>
        I am totally yours <br>
        Autumn comes, I've seen it before <br>
        Another town is not that fun anymore <br>
        I've been searching for those perfect answers <br>
        I need you more right now than ever</p>

    <h4>Chorus</h4>
    <p> She does not know, that a part of me has left home <br>
        Is never ever coming back, there's nothing I can do with that <br>
        She does not know, that a part of me has left home <br>
        Is never ever coming back, never ever coming back</p>
