    <h1>Kurt Nielsen</h1>
    <h2>A part of me</h2>
    <p>Verse 1 
        Coming home to the sentence saying, I missed you 
        And to see your happy face again 
        There is not a single moment that I ever think the thought 
        Of not returning again 
        Summer went, got pale once more 
        A brand new city I have to explore 
        I've been searching for good answers and wisdom 
        I keep on coming back with less, 'cause I've lost home 
        
        Chorus 
        She does not know, that a part of me has left home 
        Is never ever coming back, there's nothing I can do with that 
        She does not know, that a part of me has left home 
        Is never ever coming back, never ever coming back</p>
